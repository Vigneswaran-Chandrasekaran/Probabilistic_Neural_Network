##### Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN)
Python implementation for Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), which 
can be used for classification and pattern-recognition task.
PNN doesn't actually train on dataset instead it classify the 
test data on the flow, by estimating each class's posterior
probability approximated by Parzen window and the suitable class
is selected using Baye's Rule. It was introduced by D.F. Specht 
in 1966.

It have four layers:
1. Input layer
2. Patter layer
3. Summation layer
4. Output layer
